## Setup for Local Development

### Tech Stack

The tech stack includes the following:

* **SQLAlchemy ORM** - the ORM library
* **PostgreSQL** - the database
* **Python3** and **Flask** - the server language and server framework
* **Flask-Migrate** - for creating and running schema migrations

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3

Follow instructions to install the latest version of Python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### PostgreSQL

Follow instructions to install the latest version of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your platform

#### Virtual Environment

It is recommended to work within a virtual environment. This keeps the dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

If you are using Python 3.3 or newer, the `venv` module is the preferred way to create and manage virtual environments. `venv` is included in the Python standard library and requires no additional installation.
To create a virtual environment using `venv`, navigate to the root directory (`Casting-Agency-API`) and run:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
The `venv` folder should be added to `.gitignore`.

#### PIP Dependencies

Install dependencies by navigating to the root directory (`Casting-Agency-API`) and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the server locally
To run the server, execute from within the root directory (`Casting-Agency-API`):

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

### Database Local Setup
With PostgreSQL running, restore a database using the `agency.psql` file provided. From the root directory (`Casting-Agency-API`) in the Terminal run:
```bash
dropdb --if-exists agency
createdb agency
psql agency < agency.psql
```

## Testing locally
To run the tests, execute from within the root directory (`Casting-Agency-API`):
```bash
dropdb --if-exists agency_test
createdb agency_test
psql agency_test < agency.psql
python test_app.py
```
The `HtmlTestRunner` package is used to generate human-readable HTML test reports showing the results of the tests of the Casting Agency API. 
The HTML test reports from different test runs can be found in the `test-results` directory.
